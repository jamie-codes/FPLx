## Phase Details

### Phase 47: Fixture Swing Detector & Clean Sheet Probability
**Goal**: Users can see which teams have materially improving or worsening fixtures and accurate CS% for every upcoming fixture — giving proactive buy/sell signals and grounding defensive picks in data
**Depends on**: Phase 46 (v1.6 complete)
**Requirements**: CS-01, CS-02, CS-03, SWG-01, SWG-02, SWG-03, SWG-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can see a panel listing teams with materially improving upcoming fixtures (buy signal) and teams with worsening fixtures (sell signal), with the quantified ease delta shown
  2. Fixture swing view is toggleable across 1/3/5 GW windows, consistent with the existing horizon controls elsewhere in the app
  3. User's own squad players belonging to high-swing teams are visually highlighted in the fixture swing panel
  4. User can see CS% per fixture for GK/DEF-relevant teams on the Club Form tab or a dedicated panel, derived from rolling xGA
  5. DGW fixtures show combined CS% using the `1 - (1-p1)*(1-p2)` formula so double-gameweek opportunity is correctly represented
**Plans**: 5 plans (3 waves)
  **Wave 1**
  - [x] 47-01-PLAN.md — extend ClubForm + MergedPlayer types (past_ease_3gw, swing_*gw, cs_prob_1gw)
  **Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*
  - [x] 47-02-PLAN.md — TDD: implement past_ease_3gw and swing deltas in computeClubForm
  - [x] 47-03-PLAN.md — TDD: add cs_prob_1gw aggregation (single/DGW/BGW) to pipeline/merge.py
  - [x] 47-04-PLAN.md — add CS% column to GemTable (Analysis preset only, mobile hidden)
  **Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*
  - [x] 47-05-PLAN.md — build FixtureSwingDetector panel + mount + human-verify checkpoint
  **Cross-cutting constraints:**
  - `cs_prob_1gw?: number` must be written to every player in pipeline before GemTable column can render (Plans 01→03→04)
  - `ClubForm.swing_*gw` fields must be typed (Plan 01) and computed (Plan 02) before FixtureSwingDetector can consume them (Plan 05)
**Phase notes**: Fixture swing threshold (recommended 0.20 delta, 4+4 team cap) must be confirmed in the plan spec before coding. Group by `event_id` to avoid DGW double-counting in ease aggregates. BGW teams must show zero CS%. `cs_prob_1gw` field addition to `merged_players.json` (~5 pipeline lines) required.
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 48: Explainable xPts Breakdown
**Goal**: Users can inspect the component-level breakdown of any player's projected score — making the xPts model transparent and grounding the CS component in the specific upcoming fixture
**Depends on**: Phase 47 (CS-01 output required for XPT-03)
**Requirements**: XPT-01, XPT-02, XPT-03, XPT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can expand or hover any player's xPts figure to see a breakdown of all components: appearance probability, goal contribution, assist contribution, clean sheet probability, bonus points, and minutes risk modifier
  2. The sum of displayed components matches the headline xPts_1gw value (within ±0.01 rounding tolerance) — the breakdown total is the canonical figure shown, not both simultaneously
  3. The clean sheet component in the breakdown reflects the CS% for that player's specific upcoming fixture (from Phase 47), not a generic season average
  4. The breakdown is accessible for any player without requiring authentication — no login gate
**Plans**: 3 plans (2 waves)
  **Wave 1** *(parallel)*
  - [x] 48-01-PLAN.md — TDD: extend pipeline _compute_xpts_fixture + _xpts_ngw with appearance_pts; test_merge_xpts_components.py
  - [x] 48-02-PLAN.md — extend xPts_components_1gw type in types.ts; update PlayerComparisonModal.test.tsx mocks
  **Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*
  - [x] 48-03-PLAN.md — refactor XPtsCell with CSS-only hover card, useState mobile toggle, minsRisk prop; extend columns.test.tsx
  **Cross-cutting constraints:**
  - `appearance_pts: number` must be in types.ts (Plan 02) before XPtsCell can render it (Plan 03)
  - Pipeline must produce `appearance_pts` in xPts_components_1gw (Plan 01) before full integration is possible
**Phase notes**: appearance_pts resolved as explicit component (D-01). DGW: summed breakdown (D-05). BGW: no hover card (D-06). Native title tooltip removed and replaced with hover card (D-03). MinsRiskBadge shown below Total row to satisfy XPT-01 minutes risk requirement (D-02).
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 49: Player Lifecycle Labels
**Goal**: Squad players display granular timing labels that extend beyond Buy/Hold/Sell — giving managers specific action timing (Buy Next Week, Hold One More, Sell Soon, Minutes Trap, Fixture Trap) with a consistent priority hierarchy preventing contradictory signals
**Depends on**: Phase 47 (fixture swing context required for Buy Next Week and Hold One More labels)
**Requirements**: LCL-01, LCL-02, LCL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Each squad player in the Transfers view displays exactly one lifecycle label from the set: Buy Next Week, Hold One More, Sell Soon, Minutes Trap, Fixture Trap, Hold, Sell — never two simultaneously
  2. When multiple label conditions apply to the same player, the priority hierarchy resolves to the single highest-priority label (priority order defined in plan spec)
  3. Labels are computed in pure TypeScript over existing `MergedPlayer` fields — loading a squad triggers label computation with no additional API call
**Plans**: 2 plans (2 waves)
  **Wave 1**
  - [x] 049-01-PLAN.md — TDD: src/lib/lifecycle-label.ts + lifecycle-label.test.ts (7-label engine, threshold constants, computeLifecycleLabel + computeLifecycleLabels with priority cascade)
  **Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*
  - [x] 049-02-PLAN.md — LifecycleLabelBadge component + TransferPanel useClubForm wiring + SquadView labels prop swap + sell|sell_soon shortlist trigger + human-verify checkpoint
  **Cross-cutting constraints:**
  - `LifecycleLabel` type and `computeLifecycleLabels` function must exist (Plan 01) before LifecycleLabelBadge can import the union and TransferPanel can call the engine (Plan 02)
  - Plan 02 retains `computeVerdicts` and `Verdict` exports in `src/lib/recommend.ts` so Phase 51 (Decision Summary) can reuse them
**Phase notes**: Label taxonomy locked in 049-RESEARCH.md §"Label Taxonomy". Hysteresis: SELL_THRESHOLD = 0.85 (replaces recommend.ts 0.90 for this engine), SELL_SOON_THRESHOLD = 0.90, SWING_THRESHOLD = 0.20 (Phase 47 D-01), MINUTES_TRAP_MIN_COST = 70 (£7.0m gate), MINUTES_TRAP_START_PROB = 0.65. Priority cascade: Minutes Trap > Fixture Trap > Buy Next Week > Hold One More > Sell Soon > Sell > Hold. Bench excluded (pick.position >= 12). Null clubForm degrades gracefully (gem-only labels, no crash).
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 50: Transfer Opportunity Cost Simulator
**Goal**: Users can compare Roll, 1-FT, 2-FT, and Hit options in a single table — with net xPts gain, break-even weeks, and named player-in/player-out pairs for each option — making the cost of inaction and the cost of a hit both explicit
**Depends on**: Phase 46 (`suggestTransfers()` already built; independent of phases 47-49)
**Requirements**: OCS-01, OCS-02, OCS-03, OCS-04, OCS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees a table with one row per transfer option (Roll / 1-FT / 2-FT / Hit) showing xPts gain net of hit cost and break-even weeks for each row
  2. The Roll row explicitly shows 0 gain, making the cost of inaction visible rather than absent
  3. 1-FT and 2-FT rows each show the specific player-in and player-out names, grounding the comparison in real squad members
  4. The table is toggleable across 1/3/5 GW horizons and updates all values accordingly
  5. Hit options are clearly labelled with the 4pt cost deducted, and the current free transfer count (1 or 2 FTs) is reflected — options requiring a hit are flagged as such
**Plans**: 2 plans (2 waves)
  **Wave 1**
  - [x] 050-01-PLAN.md — TDD: src/lib/opportunity-cost.ts + opportunity-cost.test.ts (computeOpportunityCostRows pure mapper, OCSRowKind/OCSRow/MARGINAL_THRESHOLD exports, 16 test cases for OCS-01/02/04/05)
  **Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*
  - [x] 050-02-PLAN.md — OpportunityCostTable component + TransferPanel wiring (ocsHorizon/ocsFtCount state, derivedFtCount from event_transfers + active_chip, suggestTransfers call, FtToggle + GwToggle in section header) + human-verify checkpoint
  **Cross-cutting constraints:**
  - `computeOpportunityCostRows`, `OCSRow`, `OCSRowKind`, `MARGINAL_THRESHOLD` must exist (Plan 01) before OpportunityCostTable can render and TransferPanel can compose (Plan 02)
  - Existing `computeTransferSuggestions()` "Suggested Transfers" block in TransferPanel is preserved unchanged — OCS is additive (RESEARCH.md §UI Placement Decision)
  - `free_transfers` is NOT a direct FPL API field — derived from `myTeamData.entry_history.event_transfers` + `squadData.active_chip` heuristic (RESEARCH.md §FT Count Sourcing); ROADMAP phase note below is corrected by RESEARCH.md
**Phase notes**: When authenticated, `ocsFtCount` is derived from `entry_history.event_transfers` + `active_chip` (the "free_transfers" field referenced in earlier notes does NOT exist on the FPL my-team API — see 050-RESEARCH.md §Pitfall 1). When unauthenticated, the FT pill toggle defaults to 1 FT and remains the user's manual selector. 2-FT additive approximation combos with `xPtsGain < MARGINAL_THRESHOLD` (1.0) are labelled "Marginal — verify".
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 51: Weekly Decision Summary
**Goal**: Users see captain recommendation, transfer recommendation, chip timing flag, and risk flags on a single screen — no tab-hopping required — with a clear priority order and severity signals
**Depends on**: Phases 47, 48, 49, 50 (composites all preceding v1.7 engines)
**Requirements**: WDS-01, WDS-02, WDS-03, WDS-04, WDS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A user with a squad loaded can view all four weekly decision types (captain, transfer, chip timing, risk flags) on a single screen without navigating to any other tab
  2. Recommendations appear in priority order: captain first, then transfer, then chip timing, then risks — so the most time-sensitive action is always at the top
  3. Each recommendation card carries a severity badge (High / Medium / Low) indicating urgency
  4. When no squad is loaded, the screen degrades gracefully — captain picks and chip timing cards remain visible; transfer and bench cards are hidden with an explanatory prompt
  5. When the upcoming gameweek is a DGW or BGW, a context flag is shown on the chip timing card affecting the recommendation framing
**Plans**: 2 plans (2 waves)
  **Wave 1**
  - [x] 051-01-PLAN.md — TDD: src/lib/decision-severity.ts + decision-severity.test.ts (computeDecisionSeverity pure function for WDS-03/WDS-05; SeverityLevel/DecisionSeverity/ComputeDecisionSeverityArgs exports; 21 test cases covering captain >= 2x boundary, transfer/risk shared rule, chip DGW/BGW HIGH gate)
  **Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*
  - [x] 051-02-PLAN.md — DecisionSummaryTab component composing v1.7 engines (4 cards: Captain/Transfer/Chip/Risk) + page.tsx wiring (Decision sub-tab as default Squad landing — D-10) + human-verify checkpoint
  **Cross-cutting constraints:**
  - `computeDecisionSeverity`, `SeverityLevel`, `DecisionSeverity` must exist (Plan 01) before DecisionSummaryTab can import the rule classifier and drive its four severity badges (Plan 02)
  - DecisionSummaryTab MUST receive identical props to TransferPanel (Phase 43 D-11): `{ teamId, onTeamIdChange, submittedId, onSubmit }`
  - The OCS table inside the Transfer card is mounted with `horizon={1}` and `derivedFtCount` — no FtToggle/GwToggle in this card (CONTEXT.md D-05/D-06/D-09)
**Phase notes**: The `resolveDecisionSummary()` priority hierarchy for conflicting engine outputs (e.g., Transfer engine recommends Sell while Verdict engine recommends Hold for the same player) must be fully specced — including the complete conflict matrix — before implementation begins. Hard limit of 4 visible outputs; no inline expansion. Track oldest source timestamp across all composed hooks; surface a "Refresh All" trigger. Decision Summary pinned to 1 GW horizon explicitly labelled, or horizon lifted to shared state — spec must choose before UI design.
**UI hint**: yes
